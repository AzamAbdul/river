Since I get asked frequently by friends and relatives what a good starting point is into programming, I have decided to write a short introductory guide. Considering there are a million different forum threads, articles, and blog posts about this topic it can be quite a daunting task to get started. To be fair, this problem actually never really goes away even for a seasoned programmer; it just takes shape anytime we want to learn about a foreign topic in the field

For those that don’t know what programming actually is, check out some of these videos.

### So….how do I begin?

Well a better question to ask is *what do you want to learn?* 

The field of programming is vast, so you’ll be more successful at self-teaching and the process will be more gratifying if you have a goal in mind. For example, if you are one of my biologically inclined friends may I suggest considering bioinformatics? Or...maybe you want to learn about web development? Or maybe you wanna make a robot? Or maybe you wanna strike back at the Russians(don’t do this) and want to learn cyber security? I actually don’t know much about most of these topics but I can offer you the self teaching process that I would go through if I want to learn something new.

### I’ve chosen a topic. What now?

Look up what programming language dominates that topic and learn the basics of it (if your topic suggests C is the best language, I’d look for the 2nd best language/topic since C is a difficult language for a beginner to learn). However if you have selected web development which has a myriad of languages associated with it, I’d stick to learning html(not a programming language but let’s ignore this for now) and javascript first. Well how do you learn a language you ask? If you want something interactive and where you can just jump right in, I highly recommend [code academy](http://www.codecademy.com). But if you selected a language that’s not on codecademy I’d google ‘how to learn language X’. However, I’d recommend the [Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/) series. Both the books and code academy provide exercises that let you in on some of the basics.


*You'll eventually have to install your prefered language’s interpreter or compiler. I’m not going to get into that since that’s language and operating system specific. Just Google it.*


### I’ve completed coding exercises - I’m getting unmotivated

I don’t blame you. Many of these exercises hold your hand through the learning process but it’s required work to provide a foundation before you get to the fun. As the adage goes, “you have to learn how to walk before you can run”. However, I do think this is where most people fall off. To really understand all the pieces provided to you by these exercises, I’d recommend working on a project of your own. Specifically, a project where you aren’t given direct hints as to what to do.

Before you even begin any projects, I’d recommend you understand what variables are, some of the basic types int/float/string/boolean (the details of these will vary in different programming languages), various operators on these types (addition/multiplication etc on integers/floats, concatenation for strings), how to read input from a user(from the command line on most language or from a textbox using html and javascript) and if/then/else statements. 

**Project ideas:**

1. A program where you read in an integer from the user, if the integer is a specific value you prompt the user again for a string and then you display the string after performing some operations on it. The integer provided initially will determine the set of operations that you will conduct on the string. 
2. A program where the user provides three numbers and performs an operation on the first two numbers. The operation conducted will depend on the third number. [A more complicated version of this is question two on this years advent of code exercise](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2)
