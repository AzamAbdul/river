Take this collection of thoughts with a grain of salt for these reason
* I'm not at all qualified to give career advice
* Do algorithmic technical interviews even measure anything useful?
* Who cares what some VCs think are the best start ups to work at?

### **Interview Prep Resources**

Note IMO technical interviews are a good thing. Not only do they require you to focus on your fundamentals or brush up on some stuff from undergrad, but they can at least give you some sort of understanding of talent that you could potentially be working with. Don’t work at a place without a technical interview (it’s okay if technical interviews dont focus on DS/algorithms, but they should have a technical portion to their interview process), if they don’t, it’s possible that you could be working with not the smartest folk(there are studies that show behavioral interviews are nonsensical at predicting job performance. Therefore, technical interviews are the only ones that seem to have any benefit at all).

### **Things to Ask Your Interviewers** 

These can be used to guage the work environment you will be working in.They're primarily focused on catching red flags (bad work life balance, poor engineering practices, not enough growing/learning opportunities)

* What's the hardest technical probem you've solved since you've been here?
* What's the process like for me to take something from my local machine to production. (Aka what' the deployment procedure like, minimum test coverage, PR etiquette? See Google's process for in-depth PRs).
* What's the project management structure like? Sprints? Freeform?
* What's the most costly bug someone accidently pushed into production and how was it resolved? What's the Post Mortem culture like? 
* How do you plan on bringing me up to speed if I join/am hired?
* How many more engineers do you plan on hiring?
* Tell me about the characteristics of someone who was just promoted on your team. 
* What's the on-call rotation like?
